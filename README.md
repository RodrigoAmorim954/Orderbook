```bash
git clone https://github.com/RodrigoAmorim954/Orderbook.git
cd crypto-orderbook
```
### 2. Install the necessary dependencies using make:
```
make install
```


## 🧪 Testing

```
forge test
```
You can add flags like -vvvv for verbose output.

## 🧠 How It Works
### 🔄 OrderBook Functionality
**Create Order:** User submits a buy or sell order using one of the supported tokens placing the amount of tokens to sell and the total that the user wants to receive.

**Execution Fee:** A 2% fee is deducted from the successfull traded amount.

**Expiration:** The order can be active until 3 days. (timestamp-based).

**Amend:** The user can modify the order submited (can change the price, the quantity to sell or the expiration time).

**Cancellation:** The original order creator can cancel the order before expiration.


## 🔮 Future Improvements

Create Mocks of erc20 tokens

Initialize and Approval the tokens to be traded

Take the actual address contracts of the tokens in sepolia testnet (if they exists)
